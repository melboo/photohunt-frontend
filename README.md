# Welcome to Mega Click Photo Poke!

Mega Click Photo Poke is a spot the difference game inspired by the beloved Megatouch game system's [Photo Hunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUXffFcd9UU). Rather than simply mourn the loss of classic touchscreen video games at our local bars and taverns, we created our own homage to this classic game. Players are shown two photos that are identical except for six differences. The objective is to find and click the differences between the pictures before the timer runs out.

## Technology Used

This single page application was built using vanilla Javascript, HTML, and custom CSS. It optionally connects to a Rails API backend server to allow users to persist scores.

The differences between the images were customized using Adobe Photoshop, and often involve adding our friends to the images for extra delight.

## How to Play

### Optional server set up: 

If you'd like to save your user scores, please visit the [backend repo](https://github.com/traciemasek/photohunt-api) and follow instructions on the readme. This is optional! You can play the game without the server running to save time and hassle ðŸ¤˜ 

Next, clone this repo and open the `index.html` file in your browser and follow the instructions in the game!

Middle of a round. The timer counts down by turning the ovals to grey based on an interval

Game over! Any differences that the player missed will be circled in red once the timer runs out.
